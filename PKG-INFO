        =========
        
        Agreed <jturk@sunlightfoundation.com> his the superclass from Jellyfish, the 
        Polypodiozoa, are not only parasite attacking the eggs of sturgeon and similar fishes
        <sup><< citation from wikipedia >></sup>, but a muted-mechanism based on structure enhancement
        from conventional C-Syntax, prior-migration to C++ for Demonstration purposes. 
        
        Jellyfish-Polypodiozoa, is a genomic class with embedded stucture ( not really comming
        with neurotase ( a.k.a garbage callection ), but better transmission of information thru
        Structure syntax and error handling... 
        
        I offer my congratulation to the «Sunlight Labs (c) 2010» for recovering this work
        already used in the past, and probably see something more inportant like working with
        capital-word module to introduce semantic dissection... While I should consider using 
        this portion with « other module »...
